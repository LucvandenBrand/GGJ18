# GGJ18
A game developed for the [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org) 2018!

## Branch Workflow
### Development
The development branch (or branches related to it) contains all active work.

### Master
The master branch contains all work that is production-ready. Before anything can be merged into master, it must be approved by a pull-request!

## Build and Run
This is a Unity project, so simply open the project from Unity and build it.

## Specific Unity Workflow
Within the `Scenes` folder, there is space for an ignored `KlootScenes` folder.
This folder is for you to mess around with on your own, 
the folder is never commited such that you do not need to worry about merge conflicts.

**Keep in mind: merge conflicts are truly avoided by proper communication!**
